## Dataset: RAVDESS

This project uses the **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)**, which provides synchronized video and audio recordings of actors expressing emotions. The dataset covers **8 emotion classes**: neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprised, and disgust.

We use the subset with **spoken-video recordings** to validate the facial feature extraction pipeline and to assess sequence models' ability to recognize emotions from facial landmark dynamics.

RAVDESS is **publicly available** and may be freely used for research and educational purposes.
