## Dataset: BioVid Heat Pain Database

This project uses the **BioVid Heat Pain Database**, a multimodal collection capturing participants' responses to thermal stimuli at varying pain intensities. The dataset provides synchronized facial video, physiological signals, and subjective pain ratings, making it a widely used benchmark for automatic pain detection research.

We rely on **Part A of BioVid**, which includes facial video recordings with a five-level pain intensity scale. These sequences serve as the primary source for extracting facial landmarks and for training and evaluating sequence models for pain detection.

The BioVid Heat Pain Database **is not publicly available**. Access requires submitting a request and obtaining approval from the dataset creators.
